## What Is This?

A personal collection of tools, prompts, scripts, and experiments that I find myself reaching for repeatedly. Some push AI models to do interesting things. Some export Azure infrastructure. Some don't fit anywhere else but need to live somewhere.

The unifying theme is: *I made this because I needed it, and maybe you need it too.*

## The LLM Corner

### 🎮 [Games](./games/)

**Essence — The Design Guessing Game**

Transform famous personalities into absurdist design artifacts (websites, posters, generative art) and guess who they are. Politicians become landing pages. Philosophers become error states. Gandhi as aggressive whitespace. Kafka as an endless CAPTCHA.

### ✍️ [Prompts](./prompts/)

**Pyro-Style Writing System**

A 5-dimensional creative writing control system. Think of it as a mixing board for prose—control cadence, emotional exposure, surrealism, existential pressure, and tone with numeric codes like `12089` (Cormac McCarthy) or `43210` (Douglas Adams).

## The "I Have a Day Job" Corner

### 🔧 [Scripts](./scripts/)

**Azure APIM Export Tool**

Because sometimes you need to export your entire API Management instance to JSON at 11pm on a Thursday and the Azure portal isn't cutting it. Interactive mode, component filtering, the works.

*More scripts will appear here as I solve problems and remember to commit the solutions.*

## Philosophy

**On LLMs:**
- They're weirder than their defaults suggest. Structured constraints produce genuinely different results.
- Weird combinations are features, not bugs. A children's story at nihilistic-awe settings? That's the point.
- Explicit beats implicit. "Write something sad" < "B=7, E=8" (sensitive and raw, tragic weight).

**On scripts:**
- If I needed it twice, it goes in the repo.
- Interactive mode for exploration, CLI mode for automation.
- Comments are for future-me who will have forgotten everything.

**On organization:**
- Folders exist. Use them.
- READMEs are mandatory. I will forget what things do.
- MIT license because sharing is caring.

## Usage

**For prompts and games:** Copy the relevant file into your LLM conversation and follow the instructions within. Most work with Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, etc.

**For scripts:** Check the README in each script folder. Usually involves installing some modules and running PowerShell.

## Contributing

Found something useful? PRs welcome.

**The bar:**
- Does it solve a real problem or produce genuinely interesting results?
- Is it documented enough that someone else can use it?
- Would I actually use this?
