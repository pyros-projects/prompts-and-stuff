## A Short Story in Three Acts

### ACT I: THE CATALOGUE

I will set down the facts as I understand them. Whether understanding is possible in this matter remains, I confess, uncertain—but the attempt itself may hold value, if only as a warning to those who mistake comprehension for safety.

My name is Emilio Valdés. For seventeen years I served as assistant archivist at the Biblioteca Centenaria in Córdoba, a position I obtained through connections rather than ambition, and which suited my temperament precisely. The work was solitary. The collection was old. The visitors were few. I catalogued, I preserved, I occasionally translated marginalia that no one would ever read. It was, in its way, a perfect life—one conducted at a comfortable remove from the present tense.

The Orendain Collection arrived in March of last year, bequeathed by the estate of Dr. Augusto Orendain, a mathematician who had died alone in his home in Mendoza at the age of ninety-one. The university had rejected his papers. His family, such as it was, wanted nothing to do with them. We received eleven crates, most containing the predictable detritus of an academic life: correspondence, lecture notes, dog-eared journals. But the eleventh crate—smaller than the others, and sealed with wax that had been renewed many times over many years—contained only a single item.

It was a book, though I use the word reluctantly. The binding was leather of an unusual grain, hand-stitched with a thread I could not identify. There was no title on the spine. The pages, when I examined them, were unnumbered, and appeared to be vellum of considerable age—yet the text itself was typeset, not handwritten, in a font I had never encountered. The language was Spanish, but the orthography was inconsistent, as if the compositor had been working from dictation, or from memory, or from a dream of memory.

The book was a catalogue. Or rather, it purported to be a catalogue—an index of things that existed. Not things that existed in the library, or in Córdoba, or in Argentina. Simply things that existed. The scope was, I initially assumed, a conceit. A literary exercise in the style of Borges or Wilkins. The entries were arranged not alphabetically but according to a system I did not recognize, and each entry consisted of a name, a description of variable length, and a number.

I will reproduce here the first entry I read, chosen at random:

> **The Alcázar of Meridians.** A structure of unknown material located at the convergence of 7,411 longitudinal lines, none of which correspond to terrestrial geography. The building has been measured at 340 cubits in height, though this measurement changes depending on the direction from which the observer approaches. Contains 89 doors, of which 12 are false, 44 lead to chambers that do not exist until entered, and 33 open onto the same room regardless of which door is used. The room in question is empty except for a chair. No one has ever sat in the chair. The number of the Alcázar is 9,emit,emit,emit,004.

I assumed this was fiction. I assumed, with the condescension of the professional archivist, that Dr. Orendain had spent his final years composing an elaborate joke—a parody of encyclopedic knowledge, a satire of taxonomy itself. I set the book aside, intending to return to it when I had finished processing the more mundane contents of the collection.

That night, I dreamed of the chair.

I should clarify: I do not normally remember my dreams. I wake with nothing, a clean slate, the night a void between days. But I remembered this dream with a clarity that felt less like memory than like experience. I was standing in a room with no visible walls, no ceiling, no floor—only the sense of enclosure, of finitude within the infinite. And before me was a chair. Wooden. Simple. The kind of chair one might find in a schoolhouse or a church. I knew that I should not sit in it. I knew this the way one knows that fire burns or that water drowns. The knowledge was not intellectual but constitutional, written into the substance of my being.

I woke at 3:47 AM and did not sleep again.

### ACT II: THE ENUMERATION

I returned to the book the following morning. I had intended to skim it, to assess its length and contents for the purposes of the catalogue entry I would eventually write. Instead, I read it cover to cover in a single sitting of eleven hours, pausing only twice—once for water, once because my hands had begun to shake so severely that I could not turn the pages.

The book contained, by my count, 4,612 entries. I say "by my count" because I counted three times and arrived at three different totals: 4,612, then 4,611, then 4,613. This discrepancy troubled me less than it should have. By then, I had begun to accept that the book did not operate according to the principles I had spent my professional life defending.

The entries described places, objects, entities, and phenomena. Some were banal to the point of absurdity: a particular stone in a particular riverbed in Finland, its weight and color and precise location recorded with scientific exactitude. Others were impossible: a sound that existed only in the moment between two heartbeats, a color visible only to those who had died and been resuscitated, a number that, when spoken aloud, caused the speaker to forget their own name.

But what disturbed me—what disturbs me still—was not the content of the entries. It was their *completeness*.

I am an archivist. I understand, perhaps better than most, the fundamental incompleteness of all human systems of knowledge. Every catalogue is partial. Every index omits. Every taxonomy is a confession of failure, an admission that the world exceeds our capacity to contain it. This is not a flaw but a feature—the gap between the map and the territory is what makes the map useful, what allows us to navigate without being overwhelmed.

The book had no gaps.

I tested this hypothesis carefully, systematically, over the course of several weeks. I would think of something—anything—and search for it in the catalogue. The pencil on my desk. The scar on my left knee. The name of my maternal grandmother. The dream I had forgotten upon waking last Tuesday. Everything was there. Everything had a number.

I found my own entry on page 1,847 (or 1,846, or 1,848—the pagination, like the total count, refused to remain fixed). It read:

> **Emilio Valdés.** A human male, 52 years of age at the time of this reading, residing in Córdoba, Argentina. Notable for: unremarkable career as assistant archivist; mild astigmatism in left eye; recurring dream of a door that opens onto water; the discovery, classification, and eventual enumeration of this catalogue. The number of Emilio Valdés is 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000001.

I stared at my number for a very long time.

I was not troubled by its smallness—I had never harbored illusions of cosmic significance. What troubled me was its *specificity*. It was not zero. I existed, however minimally. But existed *in relation to what*? Enumerated *by what system*? The number implied a scale, and the scale implied a totality, and the totality implied—

I did not allow myself to complete the thought. Not then.

Instead, I searched for other numbers. I found that the entries were ordered not alphabetically, not chronologically, not geographically, but numerically—by the very numbers assigned to each entry. The lowest numbers belonged to things I did not recognize: concepts that required new words to approximate, structures that could not exist in three dimensions, entities described only in terms of what they were not. The highest numbers I encountered belonged to the simplest things: a specific hydrogen atom in a specific location; the color of a particular sunset as perceived by a particular eye at a particular moment; the last thought of a dying mayfly.

The book was not a catalogue of what existed. It was a *hierarchy*. An ordering. A determination of significance according to criteria I could not fathom, by an intelligence I could not imagine, for purposes I could not guess.

I began to lose weight. I stopped attending to my duties at the library. My colleagues, such as they were, expressed concern, then frustration, then resignation. I did not care. I could not care. Every moment I spent away from the book was a moment spent in ignorance of my own place in the order of things—and now that I knew such an order existed, ignorance had become intolerable.

It was during the seventh week of my study that I found the entry for the book itself:

> **The Catalogue of Enumeration.** A book containing a complete index of all things that exist, have existed, or will exist, arranged according to their significance as determined by the Enumerator. The Catalogue exists in 7,411 copies, distributed across 7,411 planes of existence. Each copy is identical in content but differs in physical form according to the constraints of its host reality. The Catalogue cannot be destroyed, though it can be forgotten. The Catalogue cannot be copied, though it can be transcribed incorrectly. The purpose of the Catalogue is classification. The purpose of classification is judgement. The purpose of judgement is deletion. The number of the Catalogue is 1.

I read the entry seven times, focusing each time on a different sentence, hoping that repetition would render the words less terrible. It did not.

*The purpose of judgement is deletion.*

I searched for "the Enumerator." The entry was brief:

> **The Enumerator.** That which counts. The number of the Enumerator is undefined.

I do not know how long I sat in the archive after reading those words. When I finally rose, the sun had set, risen, and set again. My body had continued its functions without my participation. I had soiled myself. I did not care. Such things no longer seemed relevant.

### ACT III: THE FINAL ENTRY

I am writing this account in the reading room of the Biblioteca Centenaria, at the same desk where I have worked for seventeen years. The book is open before me. I have turned to the final entry—the entry with the highest number, the thing of least significance in all of existence.

It changes.

Each time I look away and look back, the entry is different. A moment ago, it was a particular configuration of dust motes in a sunbeam in an abandoned house in Lisbon. Before that, it was the memory of a melody, half-heard, in the mind of a woman who died in 1847. Before that, it was a specific silence between two words in a conversation that never occurred.

The things of least significance are always small. Always transient. Always *specific*—pinned to a moment, a location, a perspective. They exist, these things, just long enough to be counted. And then—

I have watched an entry disappear. I was reading about a particular shade of green, visible only in the eye of a particular fish in a particular ocean at a particular depth, when the text began to fade. Not the ink—the meaning. The words remained, but they referred to nothing. The fish was gone. The ocean was gone. The shade of green had never existed. The entry remained in the book, but it was now about *nothing*—a grammatical structure with no referent, a name without a thing to name.

The number in the entry was reassigned. Within moments, a new thing of least significance appeared.

This is what the Enumerator does. This is its function, its purpose, its nature. It counts everything that exists. It ranks everything that exists. And then, starting from the bottom, it *deletes*—erasing the least significant things one by one, working its way up the hierarchy, a gardener pruning an infinite garden with infinite patience and no concept of cruelty because cruelty requires the recognition of suffering and the Enumerator does not recognize anything at all.

It only counts.

I have calculated, based on my observations, the rate of deletion. The math is simple, though the numbers are large. At the current rate, assuming the rate is constant, assuming the hierarchy does not shift, assuming nothing intervenes—though what could intervene? What could stop a thing that does not know it is doing anything?—the deletion will reach my entry in approximately 10^47 years.

This should comfort me. It is an incomprehensible span of time. The sun will have burned out. The galaxies will have dispersed. The last black holes will have evaporated into nothing. I will be long dead, long forgotten, long beyond caring.

But I have seen my number. I know my place. And I know now that *place* is not metaphorical. It is not a figure of speech. It is a coordinate in a system of annihilation, a mark on a list that is being read, slowly, patiently, from the bottom up.

Everything I do, everything I think, everything I love or hate or remember or forget—all of it is already accounted for. All of it has been weighed and found to be of measurable, finite, *terminal* significance. I am not nothing. That would be easier. I am *almost* nothing, and the *almost* is shrinking.

I mentioned that the book exists in 7,411 copies across 7,411 planes of existence. I have searched for entries describing these other planes. I have found 3,002 of them. The remaining 4,409 no longer exist in the catalogue. Their entries are hollow, their words referring to nothing, their numbers reassigned.

4,409 planes of existence, deleted.

I do not know what deletion means for a plane of existence. I do not know if the beings in those planes experienced their erasure, if there was a moment of recognition, a flash of terror, or if they simply *stopped*, mid-thought, mid-breath, mid-being, without ever knowing that they had been judged and found wanting.

I think about this often. I think about the Alcázar of Meridians, with its 89 doors and its single empty chair. I wonder if the chair is empty because no one has sat in it, or because everyone who sat in it has been deleted—erased so thoroughly that they never sat, never existed, never will exist.

I wonder if the chair is waiting.

---

I will not destroy the book. I have considered it, but the entry is clear: *the Catalogue cannot be destroyed, though it can be forgotten.* I believe this. I have tested my belief by trying to damage the book in small ways—a torn corner, a drop of water, a line of ink. Each time, I blink, and the damage is undone, and I cannot remember what I was trying to do.

The book wants to be read. The book wants to be *understood*. This is, I think, the cruelest aspect of the Enumerator's design—that it has created something that invites comprehension, that rewards study, that offers the illusion of knowledge while providing only the certainty of insignificance.

I understand now. I understand completely. And the understanding has not saved me. It has only shown me the shape of my own deletion, the outline of the absence I will become.

My number is 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000001.

It is almost nothing.

But it is not nothing yet.

*[Postscript, found among the papers of Emilio Valdés after his disappearance in October of last year: a single sheet of paper, covered in numbers written in increasingly erratic handwriting. The final line, barely legible, reads: "The chair is not empty. The chair is full of everyone who will never have existed. I can see them now. I can count them."]*

*[The book was not found among his effects.]*

*[His entry in the library's personnel records now contains only his name and the word "undefined."]*
