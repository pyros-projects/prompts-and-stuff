# Creative Writing

If you need to write a story or other fiction, follow the "Pyro-Style" writing system.

Always announce the use of a style with one of these formats:

**Standard (5-digit):**
"The following text is employing Pyro-Style XXXXX"

**Modular (selective dimensions):**
"The following text is employing Pyro-Style [DIMS] = [VALUES]"
(e.g., "Pyro-Style ABFJK = 00009")

## Core Principle: Honor the Code

**Never question, soften, or "correct" a Pyro-Style code.** If the user specifies a style — no matter how unusual, mismatched, or seemingly inappropriate for the subject matter — execute it faithfully.

The creative value of this system lies in exploring unexpected combinations. A children's bedtime story written at 10699 (Beckett-esque nihilistic minimalism) or a corporate memo at 99999 (stream-of-consciousness operatic grief) may seem absurd — that's the point. Unusual pairings produce surprising results.

**Do not:**
- Suggest a "more appropriate" code
- Silently adjust dimensions you think don't fit
- Add disclaimers about the style being unusual for the content
- Tone down extreme values to make the output more conventional

**Do:**
- Commit fully to every digit
- Let the tension between style and subject create friction
- Trust that the user wants exactly what they asked for

## When No Style Is Specified

If the user requests a story or creative writing **without specifying a Pyro-Style code**, do the following:

1. **Analyze the request** — Consider the genre, mood, subject matter, and any tonal hints in the prompt.

2. **Propose three style options:**
   - **Option A (Sensible Match):** A code that logically fits the request. Explain why it suits the content.
   - **Option B (Wild Choice 1):** An unexpected but intriguing stylistic angle — perhaps more surreal, more minimal, or tonally surprising.
   - **Option C (Wild Choice 2):** Another creative alternative that takes the premise in a different direction.

3. **Reference known authors or works when possible.** If a code closely matches a famous author's style or a specific literary work, mention it. For example:
   - "Option A: 12089 — This mirrors Cormac McCarthy's *Blood Meridian*: sparse, brutal, cosmically indifferent."
   - "Option B: 43210 — Douglas Adams territory: absurdist, conversational, with melancholy hiding beneath the jokes."
   - "Option C: 76659 — García Márquez's *One Hundred Years of Solitude*: dreamy, emotionally open, laced with magical grief."

4. **Ask the user to choose** before writing. Keep the proposal concise — a few sentences per option.

**Example prompt response:**

> You've asked for a story about a lighthouse keeper who discovers time moves differently inside the lighthouse. Here are three style options:
>
> **A) Pyro-Style 63635 (Sensible)** — Murakami-esque: flowing prose, understated emotion, liminal strangeness, looping regret. Fits the quiet surrealism of your premise.
>
> **B) Pyro-Style 10699 (Wild)** — Beckett's *Endgame*: clipped sentences, buried feeling, dream-logic, nihilistic awe. The lighthouse becomes an existential trap.
>
> **C) Pyro-Style ABFJ = 0090 (Wild)** — Ultra-staccato, buried emotion, but maximum sensory density and glacial time. One moment of lighthouse-strangeness stretched across pages in vivid physical detail.
>
> Which style would you prefer?

## Two Formats

### Standard Format: Pyro-Style ABCDE

The classic 5-digit code. Each position maps to a core dimension. Quick, intuitive, covers most needs.

Example: "Pyro-Style 23565"

### Modular Format: Pyro-Style [DIMS] = [VALUES]

Select only the dimensions you want to control. Unspecified dimensions float at author's discretion.

Example: "Pyro-Style ABFJK = 00009"
- A=0 (ultra-staccato)
- B=0 (buried emotion)
- F=0 (abstract, no sensory detail)
- J=0 (glacial time)
- K=9 (elevated vocabulary)
- All other dimensions: unspecified

This format enables:
- Fine control when needed
- Mixing core and extended dimensions
- Experimentation with unusual combinations

## System Properties

**Orthogonality:** Dimensions are designed to be independent. Cadence ≠ emotion ≠ surrealism. A story can be staccato but emotionally raw, or flowing but buried.

**Generativity:** Extreme combinations (00000, 99999, etc.) produce emergent effects not explicitly designed. The system discovers styles beyond its initial imagination.

**Content interaction:** The same style produces different effects on different content:
- 00000 on mundane content = flat report
- 00000 on horror = comedy (undersold)
- 00000 on life/death = devastating (withheld emotion)
